Here is my function for placing my User Control in the main form:

"private void placeUserControlInMainForm()
    {
      // Add the user control to the main form
      this.mainForm.Controls.Add(this);
      this.mainForm.Controls.SetChildIndex(this, 0);
    }"

I have an issue where the user control is not ending up in the first tab on the page.

Can the user control be placed in the first tab on the page and positioned at the top left corner?
