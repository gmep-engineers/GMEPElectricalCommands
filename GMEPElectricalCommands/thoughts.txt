Changes that I want to make to the program:
1. Be able to link subpanels to the main panel
a. Listen for cell changes in the PANEL_GRID object
b. when a cell is changed, check if the column is the description column & if the cell contains the string "panel" and after the word "panel" or "subpanel" check if there is a panel name.
c. If all the conditons are met, get rid of quotes and tildas around the panel name
d. Check if the panel name matches one of the open tabs
e. If it does then copy the values of the subpanel's phase_sum_grid object to the main panel's panel_grid object at the appropriate rows with the appropriate phase A, B, and/or C values (depending on the subpanel being single phase with only phase A and B or three phase with phase A, B, and C).
f. Listen for changes in the subpanel's phase_sum_grid object and copy the values to the main panel's panel_grid object at the appropriate rows with the appropriate phase A, B, and/or C values (depending on the subpanel being single phase with only phase A and B or three phase with phase A, B, and C).
g. If it does not, then prompt the user if they want to create a new tab with the panel name and copy the values of the subpanel's phase_sum_grid object to the main panel's panel_grid object at the appropriate rows with the appropriate phase A, B, and/or C values (depending on the subpanel being single phase with only phase A and B or three phase with phase A, B, and C).
h. If the user says yes, then create the subpanel and listen for changes to the subpanel's phase_sum_grid object and copy the values to the main panel's panel_grid object at the appropriate rows with the appropriate phase A, B, and/or C values (depending on the subpanel being single phase with only phase A and B or three phase with phase A, B, and C).


2. Delete the current panel


3. Add or remove any notes to the panel and mark breakers with the notes


4. Add an undo/redo capability
