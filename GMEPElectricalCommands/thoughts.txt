I have a function called LocateSubpanel() that receives a line:

```
private void LocateSubTotal(Line line)
    {

    }
```

I need this function to do the following:
1. Get all the text objects below the line and within its x coordinate bounds.
2. Out of those text objects, find the one that is closest to the line with the content "SUB-TOTAL"
