I want to create an AutoCAD function that does the following:

1. Prompt the user to select a relative point to use as the origin.
2. Prompt the user to select two more points as a rectangular region relative to the origin.
3. Within that rectangular region, find all the text and MText objects.
4. Prompt the user to give the selection a name.
5. Save the selection as a JSON object in a file as such:

{
 "name": "selection_name",
 "point1": { "x": "x_pos_relative_to_origin", "y": "y_pos_relative_to_origin" },
 "point2": { "x": "x_pos_relative_to_origin", "y": "y_pos_relative_to_origin" },
 "text": ["text_object_content", "mtext_object_content"],
}
